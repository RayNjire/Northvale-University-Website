      <h3 align="center" class="style18">LIBRARIES</h3>
      <p class="style29">The Northvale University has four great libraries with modernized  features and up to date information on just about everything.
      </p>
      <p class="style29"><span class="style29 style41">THE NORTHERN LIBRARY</span> <span class="style50">has pioneering  technology to match its cutting-edge design. It is home to the first Automated Storage  and Retrieval System (ASRS) in any college in the America; this uses robot  cranes to pick up books and convey them to the front desk. For the building&rsquo;s  eye-catching look, architecture firm Francis-Jones Morehen Thorp, which has  offices in Australia and England, took its cues from the surrounding landscape &ndash;  in particular a eucalyptus forest that graces the campus. Flora also makes an  appearance on the green roof, which incorporates planted areas and grass;  meanwhile, wells are used to flood the bottom floors with daylight. The  stunning building &ndash; which was constructed using recycled materials &ndash; opened its  doors in 2011 and contains more than 1.8 million electronic and print items.</span></p>

      <p class="style29"><span class="style41">THE SOUTHERN LIBRARY</span> is a Law  Library and is one beautiful building in which you wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting lost  in. The splendid space, which was fashioned in the Renaissance style in the  1880s, connects its five levels with elaborately detailed cast-iron spiral  stairs and features interiors in chestnut and ash woods. Its marble flooring  and walls, chandeliers, periodicals, case book materials and stacks of  bookcases &ndash; through which one can browse the library&rsquo;s collection of treatises &ndash;  collectively create an atmosphere of learned opulence. American architects John  C. Cochrane and Alfred H. Piqu&eacute;nard were responsible for its design as well as  that of the rest of the State Capitol.</p>
      <p class="style29">The following is a person&rsquo;s review  about the Southern Law Library, &ldquo;A gorgeous room with multiple levels of book  cases and white wrought iron to lighten it up. It is funny, I went on this  photo shoot, and my batteries gave out before I made it to this room. I changed  to my spares....a couple shots later and low battery? What, I forgot to charge  my spares? Duh!! I literally got the shots of this room by turning off camera, moving  or changing out one dead battery for another that had sat for a few minutes; I  would have to compose the shot, turn on camera and quick take the shot before repeating  above. That will teach me to charge the batteries when I return home next time  I change them.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><span class="style56">THE EASTERN LIBRARY</span> <span class="style29">by Admont  Abbey, constructed in 1776, is breathtaking in its beauty. Baroque architect Joseph  Hueber was tasked with developing the design for the dazzling hall. Resplendent  in gold and white hues, the library is crowned with seven cupolas whose ceiling  space is adorned by Bartolomeo Altomonte&rsquo;s frescos representing different  phases of human knowledge. It is also noteworthy for Joseph Stammel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Four  Last Things&rdquo; sculptures, which bring to life depictions of death, heaven, hell  and the Last Judgment. Around 70,000 of the monastery&rsquo;s approximately 200,000  volumes are stored here, and it is the largest library of its kind in the world.</span></p>

      <p class="style29"><span class="style29 style41">THE WESTERN LIBRARY</span> is one  beautiful building in which we wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting lost. The splendid space,  which was fashioned in the Renaissance style in the 1880s, connects its five  levels with elaborately detailed cast-iron spiral stairs and features interiors  in chestnut and ash woods.
